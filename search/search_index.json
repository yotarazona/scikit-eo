Microwaves and optical images with different spatial and temporal resolutions are available and are used to monitor a variety of environmental issues such as deforestation, land degradation, land use and land cover change, among others. Although there are efforts (i.e., Python packages, forums, communities, etc.) to make available line-of-code tools for pre-processing, processing and analysis of satellite imagery, there is still a gap that needs to be filled. In other words, too much time is still spent by many users developing Python lines of code. Algorithms for mapping land degradation through a linear trend of vegetation indices, fusion optical and radar images to classify vegetation cover, and calibration of machine learning algorithms, among others, are not available yet.</p> <p>Therefore, scikit-eo is a Python package that provides tools for remote sensing. This package was developed to fill the gaps in remotely sensed data processing tools. Most of the tools are based on scientific publications, and others are useful algorithms that will allow processing to be done in a few lines of code. With these tools, the user will be able to invest time in analyzing the results of their data and not spend time on elaborating lines of code, which can sometimes be stressful.</p>"},{"location":"#audience","title":"Audience","text":"<p>Scikit-eo is a versatile Python package designed to cover a wide range of users, including students, professionals of remote sensing, researchers of environmental analysis, and organizations looking for satellite image analysis.
