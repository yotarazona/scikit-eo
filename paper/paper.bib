abstract = {This article focuses on the identification, categorization and discussion of the significant contribution of anthropogenic and climatic factors in forest degradation in a region south of Peru. A combination of existing dataset, spatial analysis, classification techniques, linear regression and logistic regression were used to identify, categorize and explore the key factors related to forest degradation. For the identification of areas in degradation we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for gradual changes and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) for abrupt and accelerated changes in plant cover. The results demonstrated that the first indicator allowed to identify negative gradual trends, but also abrupt negative trends that in total represented 69.8% of the total degraded areas at a 95% reliability, while the second indicator allowed to identify the abrupt changes not identified by the first indicator, contributing with 30.2% to the identification of the degradation. On the other hand, our categorization resulted in three levels of degradation, i.e. low, moderate and high with 73.6%, 5.8% and 20.6% respectively of the total degraded areas. These different levels of degradation were mainly reflected by the contribution of anthropogenic factors such as gold mining, agriculture and human footprint. In addition, we developed a degradation risk map and showed that areas with a probability of degradation of less than 0.5 can become highly degraded regions in the medium and long term, causing serious repercussions on the environment and biodiversity. Therefore, the results of this work constitute a core of knowledge so that managers can make planning decisions properly.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach of change detection that reduces seasonality in time series by using Photosynthetic Vegetation Time Series (PVTS) from satellite images. With this approach, each pixel value represents at the subpixel level a fraction of the photosynthetic forest’s activity. Our hypothesis is based on an assumption that photosynthetic vegetation fractions will remain constant until a disturbing agent (natural or anthropic) occurs. Using Landsat data, we compared our approach with the Carnegie Landsat Systems Analysis-Lite (CLASlite) approach and with the national reports of the Ministry of the Environment of Perú (MINAM). After reducing seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation events with a new detection method. Our approach (which was called PVts-β) of detection is a simple method that does not model the seasonality and it only requires as inputs: i) the average and standard deviation of the time series of a pixel and ii) a threshold magnitude (β) that was calibrated to detect deforestation events in tropical forests. For the PVts-β approach, the results of calibration show that deforestation was optimally detected for β = (5,6), higher or lower than this range, the biases favor to false detections and favor the omission of deforestation too. On the other hand, the overall accuracy for the PVts-β approach was 91.1%, with an omission and commission of 8.3% and 0.5% respectively, while for CLASlite the overall accuracy was 79.2%, with an omission and commission of 20.8% and 0.0% respectively. The differences in the overall accuracy between the PVts-β and CLASlite approach were significant, being atmospheric noise a main problem which CLASlite usually does not work optimally. The strength of our PVts-β approach is the early detection at the subpixel level of deforestation events that, added to our new method of change detection explain the little omission obtained in the results. Therefore, the PVts-β approach -that we propose here- provides the opportunity to monitoring deforestation events in tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data, and it can be used for near-real-time change detection monitoring without a doubt.}

abstract = {The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of “good practice” recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the “reference classification” will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process.}

abstract = {Field-scale crop monitoring is essential for agricultural management and policy making for food security and sustainability. Automating crop classification process while elaborating a workflow is a key step for reliable and precise crop mapping. This study aims to develop an approach for crop classification in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, following the specific goals of i) evaluating spatial satellite-based features to guide crop data collection; ii) testing transfer learning model with subsequent growing season data; iii) examining accuracy in early-season prediction model; and lastly, iv) developing a crop classification model for estimating large scale crop area. As main data inputs, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation data were used to extract features to input in the Random Forest classifier. Spatial variability of satellite features was evaluated using Moran’s I Index and cluster k-means. Crop area prediction data were obtained at municipality level to compare with census data (standard method). A crop summer map layer was generated for three major crops: soybeans (Glycine maxL.), corn (Zea mays L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The crop classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.95. Model performance was influenced by sample size and spatial variability of the samples. The random forest model was transferred to the next growing season with 0.89 and 0.91 overall accuracy for 250 and 750 samples, respectively. However, overall accuracy increased from 0.93 to 0.95 when 50 to 250 samples of same-year data was aggregated to the model. Similar accuracy was obtained for predictions done with data until March relative to when the entire season was considered, until May. When data for more growing seasons were aggregated, the model produced more accurate early season predictions (January and February). Soybean prediction area obtained the highest performance (R2 = 0.94), relative to rice (R2 = 0.90) and corn (R2 = 0.37). The rice prediction area presented a high precision, but the crop area was overestimated due to errors with wetland target relative to other class. Lastly, this study presents the first crop map layer of the three major field crops for the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, serving as a foundation for the creation of crop type maps for other states in the country and around the globe.}

ABSTRACT = {Recent applications of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (S2/MSI) data for acquiring information about land use and land cover (LULC) provide a new perspective in remote sensing data analysis. Jointly, these sources permit researchers to improve operational classification and change detection, guiding better reasoning about landscape and intrinsic processes, as deforestation and agricultural expansion. However, the results of their applications have not yet been synthesized in order to provide coherent guidance on the effect of their applications in different classification processes, as well as to identify promising approaches and issues which affect classification performance. In this systematic review, we present trends, potentialities, challenges, actual gaps, and future possibilities for the use of L8/OLI and S2/MSI for LULC mapping and change detection. In particular, we highlight the possibility of using medium-resolution (Landsat-like, 10&ndash;30 m) time series and multispectral optical data provided by the harmonization between these sensors and data cube architectures for analysis-ready data that are permeated by publicizations, open data policies, and open science principles. We also reinforce the potential for exploring more spectral bands combinations, especially by using the three Red-edge and the two Near Infrared and Shortwave Infrared bands of S2/MSI, to calculate vegetation indices more sensitive to phenological variations that were less frequently applied for a long time, but have turned on since the S2/MSI mission. Summarizing peer-reviewed papers can guide the scientific community to the use of L8/OLI and S2/MSI data, which enable detailed knowledge on LULC mapping and change detection in different landscapes, especially in agricultural and natural vegetation scenarios.},

This study highlights remote sensing discoveries that were not detected by climate models or conventional observations, and suggests future challenges for the robust determination of climate trends. Satellite remote sensing has provided major advances in understanding the climate system and its changes, by quantifying processes and spatio-temporal states of the atmosphere, land and oceans. In this Review, we highlight some important discoveries about the climate system that have not been detected by climate models and conventional observations; for example, the spatial pattern of sea-level rise and the cooling effects of increased stratospheric aerosols. New insights are made feasible by the unparalleled global- and fine-scale spatial coverage of satellite observations. Nevertheless, the short duration of observation series and their uncertainties still pose challenges for capturing the robust long-term trends of many climate variables. We point out the need for future work and future systems to make better use of remote sensing in climate change studies.},

   abstract = {Remote sensing has transformed the monitoring of life on Earth by revealing spatial and temporal dimensions of biological diversity through structural, compositional and functional measurements of ecosystems. Yet, many aspects of Earth’s biodiversity are not directly quantified by reflected or emitted photons. Inclusive integration of remote sensing with field-based ecology and evolution is needed to fully understand and preserve Earth’s biodiversity. In this Perspective, we argue that multiple data types are necessary for almost all draft targets set by the Convention on Biological Diversity. We examine five key topics in biodiversity science that can be advanced by integrating remote sensing with in situ data collection from field sampling, experiments and laboratory studies to benefit conservation. Lowering the barriers for bringing these approaches together will require global-scale collaboration. This Perspective discusses how the latest advances in remote sensing can be used to answer basic ecological and evolutionary questions, as well as contribute to important biodiversity monitoring.},

Here, we provide a critical review of drone-based remote sensing of natural hazard-related disasters to highlight research trends, biases, and expose new opportunities. We performed a systematic literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology, resulting in 635 relevant articles from which we derived statistics relating to geography, drone hardware, disaster management application, and drone remote sensing data type and analysis method. Key findings include a bias towards: (i) mass movement hazards (38%); (ii) small (< 1 km2) (76%) and rural (79%) study areas in high-income countries and territories (64%); (iii) image-based observations of features from the natural environment (77%); and (iv) support of mitigation-related vulnerability assessment and risk modeling (54%) and environmental recovery (23%). We recommend that future studies focus on: (i) earthquakes, floods, and cyclones and other windstorms due to higher loss of life and economic impacts; (ii) larger and urban study areas in low, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries and territories to support vulnerable populations; (iii) under-demonstrated (and especially response-related) disaster management activities, which generally require observations of built features from urban environments; and (iv) data standards for integrating drone-based remote sensing with international disaster management methodologies.},
